# Video-Scripts
A selection of Python scripts I've used to make music videos.

This repository will probably get more and more files.

Feel free to use or copy these scripts.

Make sure to have all necessary libraries installed.

# How to Use
For filterchange.py, simply have your video and audio ready in a folder.

For imagevideo.py, have an image folder ready if you want.
Alternatively, just change the code so that you can have all flies in the same folder.

For both scripts, all you need to do is set the right names and run them (and make sure to have the libraries installed!).
